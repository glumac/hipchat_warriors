		<h1>Hipchat Warriors</h1>
		<h3>A D3.js data visualiation.  And potential braggadocio debunker. </h3>

		<p>Meet Joe.</p>

		<div id="photo">
			<img id="joe" src="images/joe.jpg" alt="joe.jpg">
		</div>
		
		<p>Joe is my classmate in General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Immersive</a> class. During the twelve hours a day we have spent together over the past few months, Joe has told me many things about himself.</p>

		<p>Some true, some not</p>

		<p>Joe told me he doesn't have a New York accent.  When I contested this ludicrous assertion he may have *actually* said "Waddya tawkin abawt?"... and then scurried away to buy a knish.</p>

		<p>Joe claims to be a hard-working guy.  Now this, I have no reason to doubt -  Joe's usually the first guy at campus and the last to leave.  But he has this weird term to refer to himself - "Hipchat Warrior". </p>

		<p>Let me explain:  our class has a chatroom through an excellent program called Hipchat.  We use this chatroom for a lot of things.  We post a lot of nerdy gifs like this: </p>

		
		<div id="photo">
			<i>When your regular expression returns what you expect:</i>
			<img src="http://www.topito.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/code-03.gif">
		</div>

		<p>We also share a lot of code, and help each other out when we are stuck with some programming ditch.   The chatroom is busy during the day, but really picks up late at night.  This is when we are trying to finish whatever assignment or project is due first thing in the morning and we are hoping to catch a few sweet, sweet hours of sleep. </p>

		<p>Joe can often be found in the chatroom, after conversation has  started to wind down at about 2am, saying "Hipchat Warrior Status: achieved."  He prides himself in being the last guy standing.  I wondered:  is Joe really the most midnight oil-burning member of our class?</p>

		<p>To answer this question, I decided to make a little data visualization.  I took the data from our class chatroom, massaged it with some regular expressions (while dodging flying cars), created a data visualization using D3.js.  </p>

		<p>	Here's what what our months of chats graphed over a 24-hour cycle looks like! </p>

	<div id="content">

			<h1>Hipchat Warriors</h1>
			<p>Midnight to Midnight<p>

<div id = "text2">
	<p>So what do we see?  First, <i>everybody</i> in the class seems to prefer (or endure) staying up late to work.   The chatroom's peak hours are after midnight.  Activity dies after 2am, and then picks back up around 7am.  There are dips during lunch and dinner times, and peaks during mid morning and afternoon.  All this might be expected, and you can see variations in individuals' chat patterns.  Some people are active early, and others late.  As for Joe, is he really the mighiest Hipchat Warrior of them all?</p>  

	<p>Indeed Joe is!  With more than twice as many chats after midnight than the next-closest classmate, Joe is posing coding questions and helping out his classmates more, and later, than anybody else.  But what percentage of his chats are deliriously posted gifs.  Such secrets shall remain safely locked away in archived class chat logs, known only to to Joe's fellow <span>Hipchat Warriors</span>.</p>
